# 📦 Parcel Delivery Frontend (React + Redux Toolkit + RTK Query)

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a **Parcel Delivery Frontend Application** built using **React.js**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **RTK Query**.  

The system is inspired by real-world courier services like **Pathao Courier** or **Sundarban Courier**, and it provides a **secure, role-based, and responsive dashboard** for three main user types:  

- **Sender** → can create and manage parcel requests  
- **Receiver** → can confirm and view parcel deliveries  
- **Admin** → can manage users, parcels, and oversee the entire system  

The application consumes a **REST API backend** and focuses on **authentication, role-based access, state management, and parcel tracking**.
